## Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yefeza/django-graphbox.git && cd django-graphbox
```

## Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv env
```

## Activate the virtual environment

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

## Install the dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Copy the example project to a local project

```bash
cp -r example example_local

Note that the project name must be `example_local` because the `example` project
is already in the repository and `example_local` is in the `.gitignore` file.

export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)/src
```

## Add Graphene Django to the installed apps

```python
# example_local/example/settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'graphene_django',
    'django_graphbox'
]
```

# Documentation style

Django Graphbox uses docstrings to document the code. The docstrings are written
in
[Google Style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html).
The documentation is generated using
[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).

# Gitflow Workflow

Django Graphbox uses the
[Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).
This means that all development happens in the `develop` branch. The `main`
branch only accepts merges from the `release` branch. Hotfixes are merged
directly into `main` and `develop`.

The `develop` branch is the default branch. When you submit a pull request,
please make sure that you are submitting it against the `develop` branch.

The `main` branch only accepts merges from the `release` branch. Hotfixes are
merged directly into `main` and `develop`. Only maintainers can merge into the
`main` branch. If you would like to submit a hotfix, please
[submit a pull request](#submitting-patches) with your changes and it will be
reviewed and merged by a maintainer.
